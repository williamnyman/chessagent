- check :(
- draws
- CURRENT TASK: pawn takes in passing
    - only pawn taking pawn
    - enemy pawn moves two squares forward on previous turn
    - attacking pawn attacks square enemy pawn passed over

- move grid, pics, clicks down so that it is not packed in to top left corner and make that work
- add visuals: title, current instruction, quit button, pieces taken list?, etc.
    - change chessActual so it doenst just do one game, make running a game a function, etc...
