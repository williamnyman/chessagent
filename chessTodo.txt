- ep is fucked up, can take piece by just moving to side when it is supposed to be taken by ep
- (int is not iterable when checking "ep" in move) <- i think this is no longer an issue because everything is fixed

- move grid, pics, clicks down so that it is not packed in to top left corner and make that work
- add visuals: title, current instruction, quit button, etc.
    - change chessActual so it doenst just do one game, make running a game a function, etc...

- go through and comment and clean up (list will come)
- maybe look at some optimization
