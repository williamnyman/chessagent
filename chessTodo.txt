- check :(
- draws
- pawn takes in passing
- CURRENT TASK : when 4 options come up, other avaliable moves remain blue - change that
- create file for import that has dictionaries, drawpieces, any other functions that dont need to belong to a certain class (chessUtility.py)

- move grid, pics, clicks down so that it is not packed in to top left corner and make that work
- add visuals: title, current instruction, quit button, pieces taken list?, etc.
    - change chessActual so it doenst just do one game, make running a game a function, etc...
