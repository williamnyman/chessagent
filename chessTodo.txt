- pawn skip to second space out even when piece is directly in front
- click on piece moving to go back to select piece
- pawn takes in passing
- pawn promoted at back rank
- fix castling (I think its that castleR and castleL are strings which need to be passed as coords)
- move grid, pics, clicks down so that it is not packed in to top left corner and make that work
- add visuals: title, current instruction, quit button, pieces taken list?, etc.

DONE
- makeMove (include taking and removing mechanic)
- pawn takes when other color at diagonal
- castling
- checkmate/victory function
- make stuff more organized by using import
