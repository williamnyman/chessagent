- CURRENT TASK: check :(
    - must make move that takes player out of check
    - if the total legal moves while in check is None then game is won
    - this is going poorly i have tried a bunch but not committed it cause it has sucked
- draws


- move grid, pics, clicks down so that it is not packed in to top left corner and make that work
- add visuals: title, current instruction, quit button, pieces taken list?, etc.
    - change chessActual so it doenst just do one game, make running a game a function, etc...
