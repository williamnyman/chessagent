- check :(
- draws
- pawn takes in passing
- Castling bug found by running games 1000 times: MAYBE HAS TO DO WITH PROMOTION

- move grid, pics, clicks down so that it is not packed in to top left corner and make that work
- add visuals: title, current instruction, quit button, pieces taken list?, etc.
    - change chessActual so it doenst just do one game, make running a game a function, etc...
